This is a tool to do analysis on Hearthstone stats!
Just kind of sketching stuff out right now; all this does is download and parse data from the Trackobot API given your API username & token.

More documentation will be available once this actually does something useful; my initial goal is to be able to get the same kind of information I get from the Trackobot website for any given ranked season since right now it only has stats for "all-time", "last 24 hours", "last 3 days", and "current month".

Beyond that I'd be interested in adding some more meaningful statistical analysis, for example matchup breakdown would probably be good-- knowing which decks always win/lose to other decks would be useful whereas the aggregate stats "vs (a deck)" is not really helpful. I'd also consider adding the ability to pull data from other stats trackers if someone else needed it for this to be useful.
